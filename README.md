# Spoof Audio Detection (SpAD)

_Spoof Audio Detection App: Empower you in the battle against deepfake audio._ 

## Overview

This project explores the use of machine learning in detecting partially spoofed audio. Powered by robust machine learning models and wrapped in a Streamlit interface, SpAD helps you to differentiate between bona fide and spoofed audio.

## Run SpAD Locally

1. Make sure [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/help/install/install-products.html) is installed locally.
   
2. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gohqianxuan/spoof-audio-detection.git
   ```

3. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd spoof-audio-detection
   ```

4. Install the dependencies:

   ```python
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. Run the streamlit app:

   ```python
   streamlit run Home.py
   ```

6. Navigate to the provided local URL, and yay! Start identifying your audio.
